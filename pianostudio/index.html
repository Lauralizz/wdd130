                <h2>Additional Lesson Information</h2>
                <h3>
                    General information about lessons will include: Required Book List: Piano Adventures Performance 
                    Book for current level Piano Adventures Theory Book for current level These will include amazon links 
                    to them. For materials: I will be doing just a basic half inch binder with page protectors that I will
                    fill with notes taken during the lesson, and printed out fun/recital songs that we might decide to work on. 
                    For those materials, I require an additional $5 to the payment for the first month of lessons. My lessons will 
                    take place in my parents music room located at: 360 Saddleriver Drive Dayton, OH 45458 There is seating in the
                    music room as well as in the library room that is right next door. Lessons will be $20 each for a half hour lesson. 
                    Payment is due at the beginning of the month for the whole month. Any conflicts need to be addressed before the 
                    month, and there will be no payment required for those scheduled absences. A final thing I could include is a 
                    link to my policies, or type them out. Here are my policies: Payment 1. Payment is due in full on the first 
                    lesson of each month. 2. I accept checks and venmo for payment. 3. Tuition is NOT refundable unless a whole 
                    day of lessons are canceled, making make ups for 7 different kids impossible. I am, however, extremely flexible 
                    about make-up lessons. 4. New students starting after the first week of the month are billed only for the lessons 
                    remaining in that month. Regular monthly billing begins the following month. 5. Tuition is currently $20.00 per 
                    lesson and does not include books or supplies. Scheduling and Attendance 1. Students are allowed one make-up lesson 
                    per month for illness, conflicts, etc. Please attempt to give me as much advance notice of absences as is possible 
                    so that I may adjust schedules. The make-up must be attended within the month taken; preferably the same week. 
                    2. Make-up lessons are not carried over to the next month. 3. No make-ups are given for no-shows or if you forget 
                    to come to a lesson. 4. No make-ups are given for make-up lessons not attended. 5. Arrive at your lesson on time. 
                    My schedule usually does not allow me to push into the next time slot. Discounts, Awards and Transfers 1. Lessons are 
                    transferable to students not currently enrolled. You may transfer a free lesson reward or a lesson already paid for 
                    into a gift certificate for someone other than yourself or your child.
