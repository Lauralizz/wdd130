The main page will include a summary of my piano studio and what all is included by being a part of it. How long lessons are, pricing, typical events, etc. I will include a little bit about myself on this main page as well, listing a short resume and details about my education and qualifications.

General information about lessons will include:

Required Book List:
Piano Adventures Performance Book for current level 
Piano Adventures Theory Book for current level 

These will include amazon links to them. 

For materials: I will be doing just a basic half inch binder with page protectors that I will fill with notes taken during the lesson, and printed out fun/recital songs that we might decide to work on. For those materials, I require an additional $5 to the payment for the first month of lessons.

My lessons will take place in my parents music room located at:
360 Saddleriver Drive
Dayton, OH 45458
There is seating in the music room as well as in the library room that is right next door.

Lessons will be $20 each for a half hour lesson. Payment is due at the beginning of the month for the whole month. Any conflicts need to be addressed before the month, and there will be no payment required for those scheduled absences.
A final thing I could include is a link to my policies, or type them out. Here are my policies:

Payment

1. Payment is due in full on the first lesson of each month.
2. I accept checks and venmo for payment.
3. Tuition is NOT refundable unless a whole day of lessons are canceled, making make ups for 7 different kids impossible. I am, however, extremely flexible about make-up lessons.
4. New students starting after the first week of the month are billed only for the lessons remaining in that month. Regular monthly billing begins the following month.
5. Tuition is currently $20.00 per lesson and does not include books or supplies.


Scheduling and Attendance
1. Students are allowed one make-up lesson per month for illness, conflicts, etc. Please attempt to give me as much advance notice of absences as is possible so that I may adjust schedules. The make-up must be attended within the month taken; preferably the same week.
2. Make-up lessons are not carried over to the next month.
3. No make-ups are given for no-shows or if you forget to come to a lesson.
4. No make-ups are given for make-up lessons not attended.
5. Arrive at your lesson on time. My schedule usually does not allow me to push into the next time slot.

Discounts, Awards and Transfers
1. Lessons are transferable to students not currently enrolled. You may transfer a free lesson reward or a lesson already paid for into a gift certificate for someone other than yourself or your child.

            <h3>Events</h3>
            <p>
                My first child page will have information on upcoming dates: recitals, competitions, activities, concerts, etc. This will be in a calendar format and will inform the families using my website about upcoming important dates that they will not want to miss. There will be a recital in the Fall and in the Spring each year, so I will update and post flyers to go with these dates. There will also be a party a couple weeks before each recital. Competitions will include Blue ribbon, OMEAs, etc.

            <h3>Resources</h3>
            <p>
                My second child page will include printable resources to practice theory and links to external cites or apps that would help further their knowledge. It will also have a list of my optional but recommended piano books to help further skills and try out different styles. Possible fun books like Christmas or Disney, and others like jazz and musicals. These recommendations will come with links connected to amazon for ease of purchase.
