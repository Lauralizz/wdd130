    <h2>Laura Norman</h2>
    <p>I'm Laura Norman, and I am from Dayton, Ohio. I am working on getting my bachelors degree in Computer Science. I am a Piano Teacher and an accompanist. </p>
    <p>I teach 33 students currently, and we are prepping for our fall recital! I enjoy reading, crocheting, and playing games with my family.</p>
    <p>I also love to travel! My favorite place I've been is Edinburgh, Scotland. I hope to go again soon with my husband Daniel, we have been married for two years and he also shares my love of travel!</p>
